    <h1>Why I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>\
    <p>swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer.
        When the sun is shinning and the air is warm, you will find me
        dipping in my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool,
     only three feet deep but its mine.</p>
     <p>there are only three reasons I like to swim</p>
     <ul>
        <li>I get lots of exercise</li>
        <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
        <li>I have an opertunity to be in the sun.</li>
     </ul>
